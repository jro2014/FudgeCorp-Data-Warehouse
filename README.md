# FudgeCorp-Data-Warehouse
This is the final project for IST 722 - Data Warehousing. My team was tasked with designing and filling a data warehouse for two fictional companies that were merging into one. FudgeMart was an online retailer and FudgeFlix was an online movie rental company. Our data warehouse was designed around the business function of order fulfillment. 

Several of the initial steps are loaded in here, but, unfortunately, the ETL files have since been deleted from their place in the Syracuse lab.
